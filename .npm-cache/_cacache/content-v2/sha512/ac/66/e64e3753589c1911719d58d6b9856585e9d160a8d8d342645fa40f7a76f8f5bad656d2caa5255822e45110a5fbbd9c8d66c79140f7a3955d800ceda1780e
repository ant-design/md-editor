Version][npm:latest:badge]][npm:latest]\n[![Next Version][npm:next:badge]][npm:next]\n\nAn **EXPERIMENTAL** Webpack plugin to enable \"Fast Refresh\" (also known as _Hot Reloading_) for React components.\n\n> This plugin is not 100% stable.\n> We're hoping to land a v1 release soon - please help us by reporting any issues you've encountered!\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nEnsure that you are using at least the minimum supported versions of this plugin's peer dependencies -\nolder versions unfortunately do not contain code to orchestrate \"Fast Refresh\",\nand thus cannot be made compatible.\n\nWe recommend using the following versions:\n\n| Dependency      | Version                      |\n| --------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| `react`         | `16.13.0`+, `17.x` or `18.x` |\n| `react-dom`     | `16.13.0`+, `17.x` or `18.x` |\n| `react-refresh` | `0.10.0`+                    |\n| `webpack`       | `4.46.0`+ or `5.2.0`+        |\n\n<details>\n<summary>Minimum requirements</summary>\n<br />\n\n| Dependency      | Version  |\n| --------------- | -------- |\n| `react`         | `16.9.0` |\n| `react-dom`     | `16.9.0` |\n| `react-refresh` | `0.10.0` |\n| `webpack`       | `4.43.0` |\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using custom renderers (e.g. <code>react-three-fiber</code>, <code>react-pdf</code>, <code>ink</code>)</summary>\n<br />\n\nTo ensure full support of \"Fast Refresh\" with components rendered by custom renderers,\nyou should ensure the renderer you're using depends on a recent version of `react-reconciler`.\n\nWe recommend version `0.25.0` or above, but any versions above `0.22.0` should work.\n\nIf the renderer is not compatible, please file them an issue instead.\n\n</details>\n\n### Installation\n\nWith all prerequisites met, you can install this plugin using your package manager of choice:\n\n```sh\n# if you prefer npm\nnpm install -D @pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin react-refresh\n\n# if you prefer yarn\nyarn add -D @pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin react-refresh\n\n# if you prefer pnpm\npnpm add -D @pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin react-refresh\n```\n\nThe `react-refresh` package (from the React team) is a required peer dependency of this plugin.\nWe recommend using version `0.10.0` or above.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Support for TypeScript</summary>\n<br />\n\nTypeScript support is available out-of-the-box for those who use `webpack.config.ts`.\n\nOur exported types however depends on `type-fest`, so you'll have to add it as a `devDependency`:\n\n```sh\n# if you prefer npm\nnpm install -D type-fest\n\n# if you prefer yarn\nyarn add -D type-fest\n\n# if you prefer pnpm\npnpm add -D type-fest\n```\n\n> **:memo: Note**:\n>\n> `type-fest@2.x` only supports Node.js v12.20 or above.\n> If you're using an older version of Node.js, please install `type-fest@1.x`.\n\n</details>\n\n### Usage\n\nFor most setups, we recommend integrating with `babel-loader`.\nIt covers the most use cases and is officially supported by the React team.\n\nThe example below will assume you're using `webpack-dev-server`.\n\nIf you haven't done so, set up your development Webpack configuration for Hot Module Replacement (HMR).\n\n```js\nconst isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',\n  devServer: {\n    hot: true,\n  },\n};\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using <code>webpack-hot-middleware</code></summary>\n<br />\n\n```js\nconst webpack = require('webpack');\n\nconst isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',\n  plugins: [isDevelopment && new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()].filter(Boolean),\n};\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using <code>webpack-plugin-serve</code></summary>\n<br />\n\n```js\nconst { WebpackPluginServe } = require('webpack-plugin-serve');\n\nconst isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',\n  plugins: [isDevelopment && new WebpackPluginServe()].filter(Boolean),\n};\n```\n\n</details>\n\nThen, add the `react-refresh/babel` plugin to your Babel configuration and this plugin to your Webpack configuration.\n\n```js\nconst ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin = require('@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin');\n\nconst isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.[jt]sx?$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),\n            options: {\n              plugins: [isDevelopment && require.resolve('react-refresh/babel')].filter(Boolean),\n            },\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  plugins: [isDevelopment && new ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin()].filter(Boolean),\n};\n```\n\n> **:memo: Note**:\n>\n> Ensure both the Babel transform (`react-refresh/babel`) and this plugin are enabled only in `development` mode!\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using <code>ts-loader</code></summary>\n<br />\n\n> **:warning: Warning**:\n> This is an un-official integration maintained by the community.\n\nInstall [`react-refresh-typescript`](https://github.com/Jack-Works/react-refresh-transformer/tree/main/typescript).\nEnsure your TypeScript version is at least 4.0.\n\n```sh\n# if you prefer npm\nnpm install -D react-refresh-typescript\n\n# if you prefer yarn\nyarn add -D react-refresh-typescript\n\n# if you prefer pnpm\npnpm add -D react-refresh-typescript\n```\n\nThen, instead of wiring up `react-refresh/babel` via `babel-loader`,\nyou can wire-up `react-refresh-typescript` with `ts-loader`:\n\n```js\nconst ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin = require('@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin');\nconst ReactRefreshTypeScript = require('react-refresh-typescript');\n\nconst isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.[jt]sx?$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: require.resolve('ts-loader'),\n            options: {\n              getCustomTransformers: () => ({\n                before: [isDevelopment && ReactRefreshTypeScript()].filter(Boolean),\n              }),\n              transpileOnly: isDevelopment,\n            },\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  plugins: [isDevelopment && new ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin()].filter(Boolean),\n};\n```\n\n> `ts-loader` won't work with HMR unless `transpileOnly` is set to `true`.\n> You should use `ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin` if you need typechecking during development.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using <code>swc-loader</code></summary>\n<br />\n\n> **:warning: Warning**:\n> This is an un-official integration maintained by the community.\n\nEnsure your `@swc/core` version is at least `1.2.86`.\nIt is also recommended to use `swc-loader` version `0.1.13` or above.\n\nThen, instead of wiring up `react-refresh/babel` via `babel-loader`,\nyou can wire-up `swc-loader` and use the `refresh` transform:\n\n```js\nconst ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin = require('@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin');\n\nconst isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.[jt]sx?$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: require.resolve('swc-loader'),\n            options: {\n              jsc: {\n                transform: {\n                  react: {\n                    development: isDevelopment,\n                    refresh: isDevelopment,\n                  },\n                },\n              },\n            },\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  plugins: [isDevelopment && new ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin()].filter(Boolean),\n};\n```\n\n> Starting from version `0.1.13`, `swc-loader` will set the `development` option based on Webpack's `mode` option.\n> `swc` won't enable fast refresh when `development` is `false`.\n\n</details>\n\nFor more information on how to set up \"Fast Refresh\" with different integrations,\nplease check out [our examples](examples).\n\n### Overlay Integration\n\nThis plugin integrates with the most common Webpack HMR solutions to surface errors during development -\nin the form of an error overlay.\n\nBy default, `webpack-dev-server` is used,\nbut you can set the [`overlay.sockIntegration`](docs/API.md#sockintegration) option to match what you're using.\n\nThe supported versions are as follows:\n\n| Dependency               | Version           |\n| ------------------------ | ----------------- |\n| `webpack-dev-server`     | `3.6.0`+ or `4.x` |\n| `webpack-hot-middleware` | `2.x`             |\n| `webpack-plugin-serve`   | `0.x` or `1.x`    |\n\n## API\n\nPlease refer to [the API docs](docs/API.md) for all available options.\n\n## FAQs and Troubleshooting\n\nPlease refer to [the Troubleshooting guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for FAQs and resolutions to common issues.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the [MIT License](/LICENSE).\n\n## Special Thanks\n\n<a href=\"https://jb.gg/OpenSource?from=ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <img\n    alt=\"JetBrains Logo\"\n    src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9338255/132110580-61d3dba5-f5c7-4479-bd8e-39cd65b42fc5.png\"\n    width=\"120\"\n  />\n</a>\n","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
